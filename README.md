# graphicsExperiments


A personal endeaver to learning about using OpenGL, with the ideal hope of creating a game engine of sorts.

This project depends on OpenGL 4.6, using GLFW and GLEW libraries.  Much of the work being done is in following through a tutorial provided at https://learnopengl.com/, the image resources are ommitted from this repo and the lines of code are not directly copied, but may be closely followed to learn from with some deviation as I seek to make something more of my own thing.  I also use GLM for operations involving matrices.

As of the initial commit, I've been working on this project for approximately 2-3 days.  I've got some initial figuring outs of vertices, colors, and basic texturing.  Notable deviations from my followings of the tutorial is creating my own structures for vertices, colors, and a combination of vertices/colors/textures which I called "vertextures" to help manage the data being used.

My immediate plans is to continue through the tutorial, followed by (and/or in conjunction with) making it more robust/flexible/clean/usable so that I could maybe make a "real" application out of it.
